## 6. Reflection

I would like to evaluate the [Transmission bit-torrent client](https://github.com/transmission/transmission). The project interests me because the bit-torrent protocol interests me, and I wonder how they deal with and optimize the network traffic inherent in the protocol. It is also able to be run on Mac, Windows, and linux/BSD with no real difference between the interfaces and network preformance (as far as I can tell). I would find out how they optimize their code for all three platforms.
