# Lab 4

1. Creative commons liscence: at the bottom of the page

2. Read the four criteria

3. It is important to choose a LICENSE because it determines how people can use your work. If your code dosent have a license, the rights to use it are yours alone, and thus make it hard to have people give code back, or use it for their own purposes (commercial, educational, part of a bigger project, etc).

4. If you use a project that dosen't have an explict liscence, that code isn't open, and thus belongs to the creator. Intellectual property wise, they have the right to their code, and you would be infinging on their rights.

5. I agree with the claim, the internet being more open and gopher being more closed by comparison lead to its downfall. The more open nature helped it gain more development from many different people, and allowed it to be more resilient to things like bugs. 

6. Linux uses the GPL v2 license because the origional creator Linus Torvalds's didn't want the project to restrict the users as much, while still having them contribute back to linux what they have improved. He even states that he believes that the GPL v3 violates everything v2 stood for because it goes beyond just giving back (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKIZ7gJlRU)
